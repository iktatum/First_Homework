##A FinTech Case Study of a Market Leader in Robo-Advisng##
***

###Overview and Origin###

> Betterment operates in the space of robo-advising. They have incorporated the expertise of CFP crednetialed financial advisors to provide investment and asset management guidance. It function is several areas of the personal fminance:

- Robo-Advising
- Asset Management
- Trust Services
- Financial Services

> Betterment begain in 2008 with teh advent of bthe financmial crisis by Jon Stein and Eli Boverman, but was officially began operation in January 2008. The brainchild of Jon Stein, armed with an MBA from Columbia Business School and CFA designation (Chartered Financial Analyst) was working as a wealth advisor, realized that the industry needed changing from the status quo. Financial maanagement was unnescessarily complex, and expensive. The industry did not have the desire to change and adopt new ways of working with clients. So Jon eventually met Eli Boverman, a securities attorney and entreprenuer, decided to obtain broker dealer services and form a registered investment advisor so they could  allow for clients to invest in what is now know as Betterment. 

> With a great of skepticism from Chris Sacca, a famed silicon venture capitalist, Jon and Eli persevered and Betterment eventuly did received funding via Techcrunch Disrup from Bessemer Venturesn Series A and a Series B round from Menlo Ventures.

> They acquired 400 customers the first day of operations, far exceeding their expectation of that day.

###Business Activities###

> Betterment eliminate the need for the do-it-yourselfers to conduct their own research and avoid missing boom stock market cycles and miss crashes, using Modern Portfolio Theory. The intended custoer are those looking for a simple way to begin investing, even if they have relatively modest financial resorurces. These clients will be early in their wealth accumulation plans. Betterment uses a lot of funds from Vanguard to help build their Exchanged Traded Funds Portfolios because of their low costs. Over the last 10 years, costs have become front and center in the discussipon of investing. However, the recent headwinds due to Covid-19 has helped client realize that passive investing can also be very danagerous. Betterment, in addition to all robo-advisors, will likely be looking to incorporate more customization as part of their platforms.

> Betterment is a clear leader among robo-advisors, with two service options: Betterment Digital has no account minimum and charges 0.25% of assets under management annually. Betterment Premium provides unlimited phone access to certified financial planners for a 0.40% fee and $100,000 account minimum.

> Their use of CFP to provide direct communication with clients provides assurance that they are getting truly professional adviosce on a digital platform. It tryuly was the first company to be able to prove the best of both worlds. The market for Betterment is can include every working adult in the US and that number can grow as teh labor force participation increases.

###Technology###
> Betterment uses a vast array of technologies to operate its platform.  The intial construction included Javascript and MySQL, Apache servers and Flex and  Adobe-Flash front-end design.

> Additional technologies utilized by Betterment include:

- *Applications and Data*
> Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby nginx, Cloudflare,Java, AmazonCloudFRont, Google Cloud, CSS 3, Go, Backbone, Underscore, Groovy

> It is important to reconginize all of the technology involved ini building a platform. There are many moving parts as well as opprotunities in the financial technology space. All companies, eventually, will require technology to allow them to continue to grow customers and eveluate the the best way to deliver the products and services clients need.

###New Trends in the Robo-advising Space###

> Financial advisors will be forced to show their value. The robo-advising platforms have allowed all market particpants to participate in investinig in a way that is simple. But clients who have accumulated substantial wealth will have to really show their value as advisors. Because bthe wealthy have a more nuances when it comes to managimg money, they will be forced to adopt new skill, and technologies. Some of the niches include:

- New niches (Socially responsible investing, Sharia law compliance, women-only, stock only)
- Banking services (M1 and Wealthfront offer loans and other banking services) 
- Robo Advisors embrace sustainable investing
- Nonfinancial companies with robo-advisors (overstock offers basic portfolio, but Google, Amazon and FB probably wonâ€™t be far behind)

###Competitor Summary###

> Competitors in this space in include Wealthfront, Ellevest, Personal capital, SoFI, M1 Finance, Stash, Robinhood. Traditional competitors in the personal finance industry include incumbent players like Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, and even traditional banks like JP MOrgan and Bank of America.

##Results of the Industry##

> Betterment has made a huge impact on the financmial services industry. There are now more participants in the financial markets and this has led some of the polder mincumbents to adopt both a new pricing strategy and channel strategy to maintain their customer base.  It has spurred other companies like Acorns, Robinhood, Wealthfront, to enter the robo-advising space. It has also prompted incumbents, like TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Fidelity and others, to create their own robo-advisor platforms and enter this space as well. 
 They have led the charge to reduce the amount that clients have to pay for financial advice. This has also led to an over reduction of cost in the industry, which is better for the individual consumer. 

> Determinant of success are boiled down to two main themes: New Customers and assets under management
The metrics that the company uses are the number of new customers and AUM, which stands for assets under management.
As of 2019, Betterment has acquired nearly $17 billion in asset under maagement and over 400,000 customers.
Betterment has been able to take advantage of the first mover advantage. Having come to market in 2010 has allowed them to accumulate assets at a level that has exceeded its peers. Its simple and easy to use platform turned out to be very popular to the public. There was skepticism that they made investing too simple for it to be popular. Thos skeptics could not have been more incorrect. 

###Recommendations - Looking Forward###

> If I were to serve in advisory capacity, I would recommend the company buidl out important cash management platforms and sweep option as well as an enhanced suite of banking services, like Business loans, payment processing and business financial consulting. The ability to monetize the current client base can be accompplished with additional client acquisition cost. Cash management and securities lending contributes to a significant amount of reveneus to companies that have already been in this space for many years.  Original investors will want to know how increased revenue sbtreams can be accomplished.

> I expect that the industry will undergo some consolidation. Economies of scale can be accomplished because acquiring the share of wallet can be expensive. Firms will start to look very similary b y offering the full suite of financial services, investment services and cash management services.

> Banking as a service and firms that can provide a customized way of providing service will dominate. Utilizing cloud software so that firms can deisn the financial products that they need should become a trend. I also believe that the trend will not only include financial services, but include enterprise financial solutions.
